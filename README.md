# RustyCAD ü¶Ä‚öôÔ∏è

RustyCAD is a framework for generalized dynamical systems modelling & simulation, a reference implementation of the General Dynamical Systems (GDS) modelling paradigm.

üöß RustyCAD was the original attempt at a Rust implementation of the [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/) framework. RustyCAD uses [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/) under the hood - Rust bindings for Python. Due to performance issues, the code was translated back into Python and became what is now known as [radCAD](https://github.com/CADLabs/radCAD).
